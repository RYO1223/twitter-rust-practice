## How to Run Rust Code

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. If you are using the provided development container, Rust is already pre-installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Use the following command to run a Rust file (replace `main.rs` with your file name):
   ```bash
   rustc main.rs && ./main
   ```
4. For projects with a `Cargo.toml` file, you can use Cargo to build and run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
